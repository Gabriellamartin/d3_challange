# Data Journalism and D3

I am excited to announce that I accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper!  My job is to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives. Also, creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers comprehend data.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. My first task is to go through data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. I have access to the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates data set from the U.S. Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.
